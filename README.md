# yason

Yaml, Json and Cfg parser and renderer.

This library was developed with the intention of being used in my future projects, especially for creating CNN networks. The parser does not support all YAML standards but is sufficient for reading configuration files for AI models. 
Additionally, it includes a parser and a renderer for JSON and CFG file formats. All formats use the same node structure, making it easier to convert between them and keeping the code more consistent.
