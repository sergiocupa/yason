# yason

Yaml and Json parser and renderer.

I did it with the intention of using this library in my future work, creating my CNN networks.
The parser does not support all YAML standards, but is sufficient for use in AI model configuration files.
It also includes auxiliary libraries that I will also use in future projects.
